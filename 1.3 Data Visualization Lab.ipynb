    "You have been hired by a record producer to design a guaranteed smash hit song based on data.  This song should be written in the most popular key with the optimal values of characteristics like danceability and energy.  For the sake of this assignmnet, assume that the spotify data is made up of only smash hits.  So if - for example - the most common key in the Spotify data is C# then we would want the song we are designing to also be in C#.  If a \"typical\" value of BMP is between 120 and 130 then we would want the song we are designing to also have a tempo between 120 and 130 BMP.\n",

    "Based on your visualizations and calculations, what values for each of these features would make a song a guaranteed smash hit?  For quantitative features, you might want to propose a range of values.\n",

    "We'll talk about how to do this later in class, but for now, use a large language model to help you write code to identify if there are any songs in the Spotify dataset that meet all of the criteria we determined for a smash hit.  What is/are the name and artist(s) and title(s) of the song?  Were they truly smash hits? \n",
